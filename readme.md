# Simon - Browser Game
## Description
The goals of the game is to click on the buttons that the computer lights up, in the correct order.  If the user isn't able to match the pattern, they will be prompted to try again.  If they are successful, they will be reminded to try again at tougher setting. There are currently three settings implemented in the game and the user can pick which level they want to play. Each level servers the same pattern, just the speed they are served are different.
