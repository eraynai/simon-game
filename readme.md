# Simon - Browser Game

The game I chose for my first project is Simon.  I was inspired to make this game as I really liked to play this game when I was a kid.  I also thing it will present a good challenge for me in my coding journey.

## User Stories

As a user I want the game to know my name when I provide it

As a user I want to see my score

As a user I want the game to be easy to start as well as reset

As a user I want the game to have simple and clear instructions so I can easily understand how to play

### Ideas

The idea for the algorithm of the game loop is that every time the player clicks on the button we grab the value of button and push that value inside an array.  Then we do a comparison between the pattern array and the new array.
