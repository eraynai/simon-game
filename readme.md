# Simon Game

The game I chose for my first project is Simon.  I was inspired to make this game as I really liked to play this game when I was a kid.  I also thing it will present a good challenge for me in my coding journey.

## User Stories

As a user I want the game to personal to me

As a user I want to see my score

As a user I want the game to be easy to start and easy to reset
